However, I wish to test out the skills I have learn in school. Therefore, I chose to create a new portfolio website which was hosted on git.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eIntially I considered using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own  website. However, I eventually decided against it as I wish to include blogging features into the website. While it is feasible to code it out, I wanted to make a website that can be easily maintain, especially in view of my upcoming national service.\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eAfter some research online, I chose to utilise Hugo to generate this website that you are on right now. I hope you will have a fun time exploring it :)\u003c/p\u003e\n","description":null,"image":"/images/posts/portfoliowebsite.png","permalink":"https://isaackohspaces.github.io/website/blogs/my-first-post/","title":"New Portfolio Website"}]
