      <description>New Website With the end of my studies in Polytechnic, I have decided to create a new portfolio website!&#xA;I utilized Wix for my previous portfolio website. However, I wish to test out the skills I have learn in school. Therefore, I chose to create a new portfolio website which was hosted on git.&#xA;Intially I considered using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own website. However, I eventually decided against it as I wish to include blogging features into the website.</description>
