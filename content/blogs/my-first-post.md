## New Website

With the end of my studies in Polytechnic, I have decided to create a new portfolio website!

I utilized Wix for my previous portfolio website. However, I wish to test out the skills I have learn in school. Therefore, I chose to create a new portfolio website which was hosted on git. 

Intially I considered using HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own  website. However, I eventually decided against it as I wish to include blogging features into the website. While it is feasible to code it out, I wanted to make a website that can be easily maintain, especially in view of my upcoming national service. 

After some research online, I chose to utilise Hugo to generate this website that you are on right now. I hope you will have a fun time exploring it :)
